Javascript is :
1.High level
2.Garbage Collected
3.Interpreted or just in Time Compiled
4.Multipradigm
5.Prototype
6.first class function
7.Dynamic
8.Single-threaded
9.Non-Blocking event loop

The Javascript Engine and Runtime:
JS Engine:-program that executes javascript code. ex:V8 Engine
it is two type:
1.Call stack:code executed
2.Heap:object stored

How Code get Executed:
Compilation:Entire code is convereted into machine code at once and written to the binary code that can be executed by the Computer.

source code-> Machine code -> Program Runing

Interpretation:-Interpreter runs through the source code and execute it line by line so its slow.
JIT:Just in Time Compilation ,,entite code is converted in to machine code at once,then executed immediately.
Note:Source code get compile and converted into machine code and get executed the Program.

Primitive vs Object:
Primitive are known as Primitive type and store in call stack
object are reference type and store in heap.

example:
const me={
name:'Mukesh',
age:30
}
